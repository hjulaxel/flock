## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-03

First public release.

### Added

- **A tree of sessions**, with fork ancestry drawn rather than guessed.
  In-session `/fork`s — which write no transcript marker — are recovered from
  the CLI daemon's dispatch log and nested under their parent.
- **Attention routing.** Amber for working, red for finished-and-unseen,
  nothing for everything else. Rolls up to the project row and onto the view
  badge, and clears when you look.
- **A notification bell** listing recently finished sessions, with per-session
  mute and an optional toast.
- **Git worktree branches.** Every checkout of a project's repository files
  under that project wherever it lives on disk, as colour-coded branch rows.
  Click a branch to start a session in that worktree. Read-only: the only git
  command is `git worktree list --porcelain`.
- **Multiple accounts.** One row per subscription, each with its own config
  directory and its five-hour and weekly window usage. New sessions are routed
  automatically; a session is then pinned to its account for life.
- **Project workspaces** that scope a window to one project, saving and
  restoring tab layouts, with tmux-backed parking that keeps hidden sessions
  running.
- **Orchestration verbs**: new, fork, fork-and-compact, ask-in-a-fork, rename in
  place, close with a summary, delete with undo, and drag to re-parent.
- **Optional instant-update hooks**, installed as a self-contained plugin that
  never edits `~/.claude/settings.json`.

### Notes

- The project was named **Lineage** during development. Configuration keys,
  command ids and the workspace filename keep the `lineage.` prefix: renaming
  them would silently discard existing settings and break keybindings.
